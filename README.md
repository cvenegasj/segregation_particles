# Segregation Particles
Agent-based model of segregation using simple attraction/repulsion rules. Same colors attract, different colors repel. 

## Running examples:

* <a href="https://cvenegasj.github.io/segregation_particles?agents=50&colors=2" target="_blank">50 agents, 2 colors</a>
* <a href="https://cvenegasj.github.io/segregation_particles?agents=70&colors=3" target="_blank">70 agents, 3 colors</a>

Try different settings by changing URL parameters 'agents' (number of agents in the model), and 'colors' (number of ethnicities).
